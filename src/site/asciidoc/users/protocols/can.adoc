== CAN
=== Controller Area Network

CAN is popular link layer standard which allows exchanging data between nodes and build multi-master applications.

|Default Transport:
2+|`javacan`

|Compatible Transports:
2+| - `javacan`

3+|Supported Operations

| CANopen PDO
| `read` / `write`
| PDO messages are broadcasted to the bus and have to be mapped at application layer.

| CANopen SDO
| `read` / `write`
| SDO are request/response conversations. Both read and write path is supported.

|
| `subscribe`
| - Receiving PDO messages requires construction of valid subscription.
- It is possible to subscribe to CANopen NMT messages.

3+|Options

|
| `heartbeat`
| Forces PLC4X to send CANopen heartbeat (NMT) messages to the bus.

|
| `nodeId`
| CAN node identifier. Depending on used CAN version it might be 11 or 29 bit unsigned int.

=== More details on 

CAN, despite (or due) to its popularity has ambiguous meaning.
There are multiple articles and sources which attempts to give introduction, yet very few of them is consistent between each other.

There are two dominant formats of frames - CAN 2.0A and 2.0B:

- CAN 2.0A uses 11 bit identifier and up to 8 bytes of data.
- CAN 2.0B uses 29 bit identifier and up to 64 bytes of data.

To make things worse with introduction of CAN FD amount of combinations increased even more.
Default transport used with this protocol is socketcan which is capable handling both.
Currently, only  2.0A format (up to 8 bytes of data) is supported.

=== Address Format

CANopen specification defines several groups of addresses dedicated to certain kind of operations.
Critical services and message exchanges related with them have lower identifiers making them wining eventual bus access.
